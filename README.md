Submission for [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) to predict credit card payment default in Taiwan,China

## The Questions I was trying to address:
* What are the dependent vairables for someone to default next month?
* What are the weights for these variables?
* What are some possible approaches?
* What might be the appropriate model?

## Anlysis by steps
1. Tried to understand the data first, categorical/discrete vs continuous
2. Ruled out possible solutions such as senario analysis(i.e., if Sex == 1 && if Marriage == 1 && Education == 1 && Age >= 20 && Age <= 30) or isolating dependent variables(i.e., only look at Sex == 1 and all data points under Sex == 1)
3. Exploratory Anlysis by visualization
4. Normalization
5. Decided on models based on the mix of categorical/discrete vs continuous data points
6. Applied decision tree(random forest), multivariate linear regression

## Conclusion
*TBD*
